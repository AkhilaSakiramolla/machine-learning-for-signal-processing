# Machine Learning for Signal Processing

This repository contains a collections of machine learning algorithm implementations focused towards working on audio/signal processing and image processing problems.

The folders in the repository contain the repective sorce code files for each of the implementations along with the corresponding results and output files.

Note: All the source codes are built in python and do not use any pre-existing machine learning libraries.

Below are some of the algorithm implementations covered in this repository:

## Machine Learning algorithms covered:
  1) K-means
  2) Expectation Maximization
  3) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  4) Mixture Models
  5) Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
  6) Graphical Models 
  7) Gibbs Sampling
  8) Manifold Learning
  9) Hashing

## Signal Processing concepts covered:
  1) Audio Source Separation
  2) Image Denoising
  3) Stereo Matching
  4) Voice Filtering
  5) Image Segmentation
  6) Image Depth analysis
